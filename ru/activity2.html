<h1>ACTIVITY TAG</h1>

    <p>I recently read to <em>To Kill a Mocking Bird,</em>a classic novel that is widely studied in literature classes. In it, a character says, <q>Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter <br>
    what.</q> The book also contains a powerful message that is best captured in the following statement: <br>
    <blockquote>People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.</blockquote><br>
    <br>The term <em>courage</em>is often defined in various ways. An example of an abbreviation is WHO, which stands for World Health Organization.Meanwhile,NASA is for its space missions. In programming , a simple Javascript line <br>
    might look like this: let <var>x = 10;</var> To run a command, you might press <kbd>Ctrl + c </kbd>on your keyboard.Sometimes, it's important to emphasize certain words for effect, but something is no longer relevant, it can be marked with <del>strikethrough</del>. when new information is added, 
    it can be marked with <ins>an insertion</ins>. Text of particular importance can be marked with <strong>strong emphasis.</strong> In mathematics, a variable might be letter x or y.An example of 
    system message might be: operation completed <small>successfully .</small> Finally, you can reach me of my123 <i>Main st. springfield, USA</i>
